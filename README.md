## PROJECT TITLE: ANALYSING THE IMPACT OF CUSTOMER COMPLAINT PATTERNS ON OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY

## OVERVIEW
This project analyzes customer complaint data at the Water and Sanitation Corporation (WASAC) to understand how complaint patterns relate to operational efficiency and service delivery. Using a structured data pipeline, summary statistics, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard, the project transforms raw complaint records into clear, actionable insights. The analysis focuses on complaint distribution, resolution performance, and geographic and organizational patterns, supporting evidence-based decision-making and improved monitoring of service quality across branches and districts.

# Description of the repository structure
The repository is organized to reflect the complete analytical workflow of the project, from data preparation to dashboard deployment. The data/ folder contains the raw and cleaned customer complaint datasets used in the analysis, serving as the foundation for all subsequent steps. The notebooks/ folder includes Python notebooks used for data exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, and computation of summary statistics. The src/ folder contains reusable Python scripts that handle data processing functions and KPI calculations to ensure consistency across the project. The app/ folder hosts the Streamlit application code responsible for building the interactive dashboard and visualizations. The assets/ folder stores screenshots or figures used for documentation and demonstration purposes. Finally, the README.md file provides an overview of the project, explains how the repository is structured, and gives instructions on how to run the analysis and dashboard.
